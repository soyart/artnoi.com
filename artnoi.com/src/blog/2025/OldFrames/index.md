# OldFrames

I just started a new open-source wiki project for vintage frames,
[OldFrames](https://oldframes.github.io/wiki/).

This is because after 6 months into this hobby, references are still
very hard to come by, and there's no well organized knowledge base to leech on,
unlike other similar hobbies like watches.

[OldFrames source](https://github.com/OldFrames/wiki) is built on top of [logsex](https://github.com/soyart/logsex),
and takes only ~1 minute to build and deploy most of the new changes.

To contribute:

- Get Logseq

- Clone OldFrames, and run script to install cleanup Git hooks

- Edit in Logseq

- Open PRs for changes

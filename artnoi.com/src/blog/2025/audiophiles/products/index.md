# Audiophile products

Consumer audio products are audio hardware or software marketed towards normal people,
and could be mobile, desktop, or floorstanding.

Audiophile products are those audio hardware or software,
but *marketed* towards [audiophiles](../analysis) instead.

Some companies, like Sony, sells both consumer audio and audiophile products.
This means that we can't just say Sony products are all shit because they are for audiophiles.

In this article I'll be writing how I detect audiophile products, how to handle or ignore
their marketing materials and claims, and how sometimes it's ok if you buy one.

## Audiophile product differences

> This usually has to do with the product manufacturers

Since audiophiles are everywhere and could be anyone from any social group,
we can assume that there're a shit ton of options out there for everyone.

These products all differ greatly, in many aspects. For example:

- Prices

    There're many segments of audiophile products, from cheapo \$99 Chinese DAC/AMP (tube),
    to overpriced golden-clad preamplifier selling for over \$20,000.

    Some of these products might have attained godhood status and are highly sought after,
    like vintage McIntosh amplifiers that sell for more than a new one.

    > When I say a product is overpriced, it means that the product is priced too high relative
    > to its audio performance. Expensive but exceptionally good products do not count as overpriced.

- Marketing

    Most of the time, if the company only targets hi-end audiophiles,
    then the marketing material will be full of bullshit.
    These hi-fi bullshit companies will use heavy pseudoscience vocabulary in their marketing materials,
    and will use some elusive and ambiguous words to describe the device performance (sound).
    Their products will some how get 10 awards from audiophile magazines.
    Like with [MIT Audio](https://mitcables.com/product/acc-268-revision-3-articulation-control-console/)

    Some hi-fi companies attempt to appear more scientific by
    providing some form of measurements in their marketing materials,
    or even feature legit audio engineering. However, they can't resist the urge to make $$$ with
    overpriced cables and 32-bit audio players. Example of this might be [FiiO](https://www.fiio.com/).
    Usually, these companies are ok to buy from if you stay away from the snake oil products.

    Some companies instead focus on measurements as their main marketing material. Usually, the products
    from these companies are ok to buy from if verified by independent measurement. But there're still
    a catch - some companies do measure their products, but they design and engineer stuff with flawed methodology,
    like [Yulong products](http://www.yulongaudio.com/) which perform quite well but are implemented with overengineered
    legacy tech like discrete class A amplifier.

    Some makers are truly superb - they just engineer and measure their thing properly, and their selling points
    are objective audio performance. Example of this might be JDS Labs and Topping.

    Please do buy and support the good guys

- Engineering

    I'd like to think there're 3 types of engineering in audio products:

    - Superb engineering

        These companies are just pumping out really good audio products that perform really, really well.
        The engineers are properly trained and educated, and their main focus is purely audio.
        Most of the time, the stuff they sell sits between pro and consumer space.

        Examples include Sennheiser, Etymotic, Topping, JH Audio

    - Proper engineering

        This usually comes from well established non-audiophile companies, like THX, Apple, and other house names.
        These products are designed by normal engineers who know what they're doing.

        If their products don't perform as well as audiophile companies, it's because the engineers made a trade-off,
        or that the performance is good enough for the price point and intended use cases,
        like how the Apple USB-C to 3.5 adapter won't support 32-bit audio but performs well enough for 16-bit (>100dB SINAD).

    - Pseudo-engineering

        Some products are designed with the wrong understanding of audio.
        Sometimes, they measure ok, and that's fine. But sometimes, it's just outright bad engineering,
        as with AudioGD products or all those tube amplifiers.

        Expensive cable-first companies like Cardas, Kimber, and MIT all fit in this group.
        Normal cable-first companies like Canare do not fall in this group.

        Japanese audio companies usually fall into this group, even giant like Sony, with their stupid
        audiophile SD cards, and top-of-the-line unobtanium clad audio players.

        The worst thing about these products is how the engineers went to great lengths to overengineer
        the products only for them to perform worse than an Apple audio adapter dongle.

    - No engineering

        Some products are not the fruits of engineering. I mean, yay some engineers probably designed it,
        but they did not apply engineering best practices or even principles when designing the thing.

        Examples include all those 

- Physical appearances

    While some audiophiles products look like they're from the year 2112, like B&W and Wilson speakers.

    Some look and feel very solid, like real pro audio equipment, like Topping devices.

    Some retain the retro looks, like McIntosh products.

    Some look like they're being put together by children with no QC process
    (Usually these products will be perceived by audiophiles as good investment - look shitty but sound heavenly),
    like AudioGD and obscure Chinese tube amps.

    Some are very beautifully sculpted, with gold inlays and piano black finish
    and hand turned engravings, or beautifully braided as with Kimber cables.

## Spotting and avoiding bad audiophile products

Because [they differ in so many aspects](#audiophile-product-differences), including actual technical features,
determining which products to avoid can get difficult.

With my purchase experience, I'd say the best steps to determine if you should buy an audio product is
to follow this guide, step-by-step.

1. Manufacturer

    Shitty products are made by shitty companies. Likewise, good products come from competent companies.

    If you have know or have a list of all the shitty companies, then you can very easily just use the list
    as blacklist. Now you just don't buy from blacklisted companies.

2. Marketing

    If the marketing materials look really good, with all the relevant specs and measurements,
    then you can happily buy the products if the numbers are acceptable.

    If the product's marketing materials show some amount of stupid audio claims, but the claim's not outragously bad,
    then you may still buy the products if further steps are ok with it.

    For example, FiiO has a lot of nonsense marketing claims. But its products are decent. Those marketing claims
    are only meant the mislead the gullible audiophiles in order for the products to sell.

    Now, if during browsing you come across really, really bad pseudoscience engineering claims (like quantum physics),
    then you don't buy the product even if the product performs good. This is because it might be overpriced,
    but worst of all is that now you financially support those scammers.

3. Technical features

    Now that we know the makers are qualified and they are not scamming us or selling us overpriced piece of equipment,
    we can now focus on the product's features.

    Examples of features include balanced connections, lo-hi gains, DSD, max power, etc.

3. Objective performance

    If a product has reached this decision node, then we'll have almost bought it. The next thing to do is to
    find out about its performance for the use case you're doing.

    Manufacturer-provided measurements are good, but it would be much better if we can get independent measurements
    too, e.g. from AudioScienceReview.

    Now, the hard part is, how "good" you really need. You can go to [/blog/etc/audio-fidelity] for more details.
    As a rule of thumb, use 16-bit audio and your listening SPL as reference. Your system'll need around 100-120dB of SINAD
    for the gear to sound truly transparent in quiet room.

    Once you verified its performance, then you can justify it by yourself if the price is ok for what you're getting.
    You can compare the product's price to its competitors with equivalent performance.

With this guide, you can now go and shop audio products with better attitude.

## My past as an audiophile

I have met so many audiophiles throughout my life. My first experience with
one was in 2004 when I was 6, where I was introduced to the world of gold cables, tube amps,
and horn speakers by a rich uncle.

Years later around 2010, I begin to buy my first quality audio products.
My first purchases are Grado-Alessandro MS-1i headphones and Monster Turbine earphones.
After my purchase, I began checking audiophile forums daily, reading reviews and discussions
for more expensive headphones and equipment.

That journey into audiophile forums turned me into an audiophile. Since, I had bought so many
audiophile products like a hi-fi USB cable and a discrete class A headphone amplifier,
and countless other hardware. I even ordered a custom made gold-silver-copper hybrid
10CM 3.5mm audio connector cable from a boutique maker, and a short handmade USB A-B interconnect
for my mobile DAC.

I quited being an audiophile back in around 2018 after I came across Ethan Winer's writings.
He wrote ["The Audio Expert"](https://ethanwiner.com/book.htm), a textbook in audio engineering
still in use in universities today.

By the time I quited, I already own a lot of audio gear. 2-3 desktop amplifiers, 2 mobile DAC/amps,
and a ton of headphones and earphones.

I naturally stop buying anything new except the transducers, until I bought the ER4SR.
The in-ear monitors are so good (and versatile) I just stop caring about other headphones,
except a custom monitors, which has always been my dream (it looks cool).
I only buy non-transducer stuff when I really need the functionality, like Bluetooth.

used laptop with great Linux/BSD support.</p><p>In 2019, after doing some YouTube research (lol) I decided to only get a used ThinkPad,
as the line was used extensively by free software programmers I admire.</p><p>I then chose some candidates, most were 2nd-3rd generation (Lenovo) ThinkPads (T420, T430, T530, X220, X230)
because they offer quite nice combination of cost, dated designs (desirable), performance, and power consumption.</p><p>I ended up with the X-series because my lifestyle requires some degree of portability from my laptop.</p><p>I came over a good deal on eBay for the X230, and I went for it. The machine came with nasty keyboard (full of crumbs)
and 85% overall condition, which is quite nice for $160 or so.</p><h2 id=design-and-build-quality>Design and build quality</h2><blockquote><p>*If you analyse the function of an object, it&rsquo;s form often becomes obvious.&rdquo;</p><ul><li>F.A.Porsche</li></ul></blockquote><p>I was very, very accustomed to Apple products and their clean, minimalist industrial design.</p><p>I had always believed that my expensive, luxury laptop is a premium machine, so it is quite
fragile like a Patek watch, i.e. I <strong>did not</strong> care if my Mac is very hard to disassemble,
very non-modular, or very prone to failure (as in the case of the keyboards
on my 2016 and 2018 MBPs).</p><p>After using this X230 for a month, I changed my mind about how a computer
should be designed and built - I now value durability, well-thought design,
modularity, availability of parts, ease of repair, and useful designs.</p><p>A luxury computer for me now is a machine that works and lasts, and doesn&rsquo;t get in my way.</p><p>I used to think designing a computer was just similar to designing other consumer products -
but now that I value my computing and computers more, I think <strong>my machine should be very well-built,
well-engineered, durable enough I don&rsquo;t have to worry about it dropping/falling/etc,
while still being minimalist enough that it doesn&rsquo;t distract me from my work</strong>.</p><p>The moment you open your old ThinkPads to service them, you know what a good design is.
Because of this modularity and ease of servicing, I find myself stocking a pile of parts
(e.g. bezels, covers, palmrest, keyboards, trackpads, etc) to renovate and service the machine
(and the costs now had exceeded the amount I paid for my X230).</p><h2 id=hardware-and-original-condition>Hardware and original condition</h2><p>The laptop houses an <strong>Intel i5-3320M</strong> mobile-class, dual-core, hyperthreaded processor
which I can happily assure you that the performance you get from this mobile CPU is very respectable,
more so than my old 2015 MacBook Air which has similar 5th-gen i5 but the Mac CPU is ultrabook-class
(worst for a Core i CPU, and the 13&rdquo; MacBook Pro still uses U-class CPU today).</p><p>Yes, the 3320M still outperforms 5250U. My X230 came with 8GB Samsung DDR3L memory, a TN-panel screen,
3-cell external battery, and a 128GB Toshiba SATA SSD.</p><h2 id=upgrading-x230-hardware>Upgrading X230 hardware</h2><p>I later upgraded memory to 16GB DDR3L (Crucial), replaced the old disgusting TN panel with an IPS screen,
equipped it with a brand-new, healthy 9-cell original battery, installed new keyboard and palmrest,
and upgraded storage to 500GB (WD Blue SATA SSD, 250GB, and Samsung EVO 860 mSATA SSD, 250GB).</p><p>After the upgrade, I find myself always reaching out for the ThinkPad instead of
my more expensive, lighter, and more <em>usable</em> 2018 MacBook Pro.</p><h2 id=operating-systems-and-disk-configuration>Operating systems and disk configuration</h2><p>Currently all my root filesystems reside on slower mSATA Samsung SSD (running at SATA 2 speed)
while I usually leave the SATA 2.5-inch drive bay empty, because the mSATA one consumes less power,
and the Samsung drive I/O is not slow at all for my usage, maybe because my software is not bloat (lol).</p><h3 id=arch-linux-https-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-linux-distribution><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution>Arch Linux</a></h3><p>My daily driver. Highly customizable and configurable.</p><p>There are 2 Arch installations on the X230,
<a href=https://artnoi.com/cheat/lvm>one on LUKS</a> and <a href=/blog/arch-zfs.html>one on ZFS</a>.</p><h3 id=void-linux-https-voidlinux-org><a href=https://voidlinux.org>Void Linux</a></h3><p>My old X230 staple. I installed it on LUKS and LVM, though I no longer use Void.</p><h3 id=freebsd-https-freebsd-org-release><a href=https://freebsd.org>FreeBSD</a> (Release)</h3><p>My first OS to be installed on the X230. X230 has excellent support on FreeBSD.</p><h2 id=user-experience>User experience</h2><p><strong>Superb!</strong> Aside from inferior screen and battery life, this <span class="math inline">\(160+\)</span>200 7-year-old laptop
is more pleasing to use than my overpriced ($2,000) 2018 MacBook Pro - the ThinkPad has
better construction, much better keyboard, and much better software (because I installed
and configured everything myself).</p><p>It also boots really fast, much faster than my MacBook Pro. This is mainly because of
software but since my Mac was sold as a hardware/software package with no alternative OS
so I think it&rsquo;s quite fair to compare the two.</p><p>The weight and dimension difference doesn&rsquo;t affect the portability so much, after all,
this <em>was</em> 2012&rsquo;s ultraportable laptop computer.</p><h2 id=footnotes>Footnotes</h2><h3 id=damaged-x220-7-row-keyboard>(Damaged) X220 7-row keyboard</h3><blockquote><p><strong>WARN:</strong> As of 2019, classic keyboard BIOS patch <a href=https://github.com/hamishcoleman/thinkpad-ec>thinkpad-ec</a>
will NOT work on X230 with 1.77 firmware installed.</p></blockquote><p>So today (Oct 17 2019), I installed ThinkPad classic keyboard (X220 keyboard) on my X230 without
isolating the internal connector pins as per the <a href=http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Install_Classic_Keyboard_on_xx30_Series_ThinkPads>ThinkWiki recommendation</a>,
and thus the keyboard was over-heating and hit with excessive current which damaged my middle button.</p><p>As a result, trackpoint scrolling doesn&rsquo;t work, and this has ruined my experience on this computer.</p><p>I use the terminal all day and this issue had made my life a bit harder.</p><p>But after all, <strong>typing on the classic keyboard feels much better</strong>, and I can still use arrow keys
or page-up/down keys to scroll through documents.</p><p>As of Oct 2019, Lenovo has started signing its BIOS updates with digital signature which prevents me from
patching the BIOS for the new keyboard - which means that some keys are not working as of now.</p><p>Volume keys, brightness keys (F8-9 instead) still works so I actually don&rsquo;t have much to complain.</p><p>However, my school work requires me to do a lot of web browsing, and not having my middle-button
working properly can get in my way while I&rsquo;m working, so <strong>I swtiched back to X230 keyboard</strong>.</p><h3 id=damaged-middle-scroll-key-my-workaround>Damaged middle scroll key: my workaround</h3><ol><li>Use arrow keys - works for most apps</li><li>Map some keys in software, e.g. <code>.Xresources</code></li></ol><h3 id=my-x230-technical-specifications>My X230: Technical Specifications</h3><ul><li>CPU: Intel i5-3320M</li><li>Network: Intel 8259 Gigabit</li><li>Wireless: Intel Centrino 6250</li><li>SSD Storage: WD Blue SATA (250G)B + EVO 860 mSATA (250GB)</li><li>Memory: Crucial 16GB, 1600MHz DDR3L (1.25V)</li><li>Display: 1366x768 IPS Panel</li></ul><h4 id=modification-s>Modification(s)</h4><ul><li>OEM Backlit Keyboard</li><li>OEM X220 Keyboard</li><li>OEM X220, X230 Palmrests</li><li>OEM Screen Panel(from TN to IPS)</li><li>OEM Screen Bezel</li><li>OEM Front Cover</li><li>Original 9-cell Battery</li></ul><h4 id=geekbench4>Geekbench4</h4><p><a href=https://browser.geekbench.com/user/artnoi>Here</a> is the Geekbench 4 results of my computers</p><hr><p><a href=#top>Back to top</a></p><hr><footer><p>Copyright (c) 2019 Prem Phansuriyanon</p><p>Verbatim copying and redistribution of this entire page are permitted provided this notice is preserved</p></footer></body></html>

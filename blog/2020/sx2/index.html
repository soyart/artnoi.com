The case feels solid, lightweight, and is better finished than my <a href=/blog/2019/thinkpad/ >ThinkPad X230</a>. The machine is easily serviceable - all I see are standard Philips screws, although apparently custom-made. A non-techinal person can surely open the case to access the internals. I dislike a few things about the platform - namely the unsercured drive bay (the 2.5-inch drive is held in place by friction), small keyboad size with weird non-character key layout, and the fact that it does not feature a <em>proper</em> power button.</p> <h2 id=support-from-panasonic>Support from Panasonic</h2> <p>Panasonic sucks compared to Lenovo when it comes to software&#47;hardware support. The parts are hard to obtain (compared to Think products), maybe due to the fact that the laptop is <strong>made in Japan</strong>. Software support is even worse - Panasonic expects you to use Windows when it comes to upgrading the system embedded controller firmware on this model.</p> <p>The machine came out in 2012-2013, and the latest BIOS update available from Panasonic was from 2018. <a href=https://na.panasonic.com/us/support/toughbook-support-center#>The latest BIOS update</a> <em>depends</em> on the <a href=https://na.panasonic.com/us/support/mandatory-safety-bulletin-cf-c2-cf-sx>earlier battery monitoring firmware</a> released by Panasonic back in Windows 7-8 days. Therefore, the update procedure requires you to use Windows (specifically 7-8 for the shitty battery monitor utility) to execute the update program - which I really hate to do. I had to buy a key for the Windows 10 Pro so that I could install the update, only to find out that the latest build of Windows 10 Pro cannot do the battery monitoring firmware stuff - which mean that currently I lack the access to the latest BIOS update. Also, as per my BIOS setting page, the machine seems to only support legacy boot.</p> <h2 id=bottom-line>Bottom-line</h2> <p><strong>Don&#8217;t buy it</strong>. If you want a Toughbook, just get the semi-rugged or fully-rugged one, or the newer Let&#8217;s Note, because I don&#8217;t see any useful value in this old SX2 Toughbook. But I bought it nonetheless (lol, how can you resist a $100 MIJ&#47;JDM laptop?)</p> <hr> <p><a href=#top>Back to top</a></p> <hr> <footer> <p>Copyright (c) 2019 - 2023 Prem Phansuriyanon</p> <p>Verbatim copying and redistribution of this entire page are permitted provided this notice is preserved</p> </footer> </body> </html>

On Mac, I need external expensive program &#8216;BitPerfect&#8217; to do the bit-perfect output to USB DACs.</p> <p>On <strong>Arch Linux</strong> however, everything is super easy - you just install <code>pulseaudio-alsa</code> and boom, you get the DAC working at the right sample rate.</p> <p>This means that when I watch Blu-ray videos 48KHz audio, the dac operates at 48KHz, and when I&#8217;m listening 44.1KHz music, the DAC operates at 44.1KHz.</p> <p>And it does all this without a single failure - much better than the paid BitPerfect for Mac.</p> <p>I don&#8217;t buy into High-res audio, so I haven&#8217;t tested it yet, but I think it should act the same way.</p> <p>If you have multiple DACs, you may want to install <code>pvaucontrol</code> so that you can graphically switch the audio sinks without having to learn the command-line.</p> <hr> <p><a href=#top>Back to top</a></p> <hr> <footer> <p>Copyright (c) 2019 - 2023 Prem Phansuriyanon</p> <p>Verbatim copying and redistribution of this entire page are permitted provided this notice is preserved</p> </footer> </body> </html>

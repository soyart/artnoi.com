The reasons I don&#8217;t use it with music is simply because it&#8217;s not really transparent, which sucks because I like music with transparent headphones, especially my Etymotic ER4SR.</p> <p>HE4XX really shines with movies - planar magnatic bass response and spikes in the high frequency range makes watching action films really enjoyable. Speech is also very clear, and the &#8220;soundstage&#8221; is just right.</p> <p>Subjectively, HE4XX masks poor quality audio better, which makes it good for movies audio which is not always very well recorded and mastered.</p> <p>HD4XX is also quite comfortable to wear throughout the movie sessions. Only recently has I found its true potential as a movie headphones, before that they just sat unused. I now use it regularly for watching anime or movies. Now I wonder if my K7XX is the same (I don&#8217;t really like K7XX with music so I gave it away to my counsin).</p> <p>So if you want a pair of comfortable headphones for movies, just give HE4XX a try. Note that I use my headphones with a desktop amplifier - if you don&#8217;t own one, you may not be able to crank the volume up wekk enough (without distortion) and your experience may differ with mine.</p> <h2 id=Compared%20to%20my%20Sennheiser%20HD600>Compared to my Sennheiser HD600</h2> <p>I enjoy music better with HD600, but when it comes to movies, I like HE4XX more, simply because the sound makes movies much more enjoyable. Maybe it is because HD600 is a lil bit too &#8220;in your face&#8221; sounding, and the &#8220;soundstage&#8221; is not very impressive for movies.</p> <hr> <p><a href=#top>Back to top</a></p> <hr> <footer> <p>Copyright (c) 2019 - 2023 Prem Phansuriyanon</p> <p>Verbatim copying and redistribution of this entire page are permitted provided this notice is preserved</p> </footer> </body> </html>

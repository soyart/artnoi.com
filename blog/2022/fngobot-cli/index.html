Everything was highly coupled, everywhere and out of place.<p>But after <a href=/blog/2021/dev/>I got a new job</a>, I have been refactoring the code to the point that I can now easily add a new quote source in <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> hour, or even add new interface to the bot. And I did just that.<p>Now that I also write tests, adding new feature or refactoring also becomes much easier.<h2 id=what-i-had-to-do>üìù What I had to do</h2><h3 id=categorization>Categorization</h3><p>So first I had to identified which part of the bot is a lib, and which part a main. Then I categorized code into roughly 4 packages:<ol><li><p>Package <code>cmd</code> is where the <code>main</code> programs live.<li><p>Package <code>bot</code> deals with bot logic, such as handling alerts, getting quotes based on source, etc.<li><p>Package <code>parse</code> defines a parsing function. Because both the Telegram bot and CLI versions use this package, their commands are 100% compatible.<li><p>Package <code>fetch</code> deals with getting quotes from remote APIs.<li><p>Package <code>enums</code> for enums. lol.</ol><h3 id=writing-cli-handlers>Writing CLI handlers</h3><p>FnGoBot interacts with users via <em>handlers</em>. And before CLI, FnGoBot had only 1 type of handlers: Telegram bot handlers.<p>The Telegram bot handler is an interface, but the implentation is a struct with all the fields required by a Telgram chatbot embedded. So a CLI handler should me much more simpler and minimalistic than the Telegram bot handler.<p>All I had to do was to create a new package <code>bot/handler_cli</code> and write code!<h2 id=other-recently-fngobot-features>Other recently FnGoBot features</h2><h3 id=fetch-quoter-interface><code>fetch.Quoter</code> interface</h3><p>The <code>fetch.Quoter</code> interface abstracts how quotes can be passed around to functions. It defines 3 methods: <code>Last()</code>, <code>Bid()</code>, <code>Ask()</code>.<p>To add a new quote source, I&rsquo;ll just have to parse its API data into a struct that implement this interface, and the entire FnGoBot can now use quotes from that new sources.<h3 id=handlers-management>Handlers management</h3><ol><li><p>Users can now see all of the handlers with <code>/handlers</code><li><p>Users can also stop a running handler with <code>/stop &lt;UUID></code><li><p>Handlers are stored per-sender in a map, so now users can only see and stop their own handlers</ol><hr><p><a href=#top>Back to top</a><hr><footer><p>Copyright (c) 2019 - 2023 Prem Phansuriyanon<p>Verbatim copying and redistribution of this entire page are permitted provided this notice is preserved</footer>

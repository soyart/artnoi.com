This blog post will be about the last year, <a href=/blog/2021/>2021</a>, and also about my plans for <a href=/blog/2022/>2022</a>.</p><h2 id=2021-milestones>2021 Milestones</h2><h3 id=dec-2020-left-my-comfort-zone>Dec 2020: Left my comfort zone</h3><h2 id=empty>🛋️</h2><p>I had been <em>programming</em> before, but in Bash (😂). Although shell scripting and actual programming are very different, I believe that my experience with shell scripting had helped me learn programming a lot.</p><p>I remember when I first learned Swift in 2018, which was before I learned to write shell scripts, I was really struggling to grasp the basic ideas of programming. But after I came back to programming after having written shell scripts, everything seemed much less difficult.</p><p>In December 2020, I decided to quit my old, boring job and focus on learning Go.</p><h3 id=early-2021-learned-programming>Early 2021: Learned programming</h3><h2 id=empty-1>⌨️</h2><p>This was when I was comfortable with Go, but still wanted to try new languages. I tried Python, Rust, Javascript. I ended up hating Python, liking Javascript, and loving Go.</p><p>I have to admit I was still too dumb to learn Rust during this period, although the concept of helpful compiler and Rust trade-off decisions really grew on me.</p><blockquote><p>Personally, I believe Rust will be BIG. It is a modern C, and much safer.</p></blockquote><p>My first software that actually has real world use, <a href=https://github.com/soyart/gfc>gfc</a>, was first written during this period.</p><h3 id=mid-2021-got-a-full-stack-cert>Mid 2021: Got a full-stack cert</h3><p>📜</p><p>I also managed to get my full-stack Javascript certification from Thai Programmer Association. I finished this course in ~5 months, and the final project for the course was <a href=https://doggovac.artnoi.com>DoggoVac</a></p><h3 id=late-2021-got-a-job-blog-2021-dev>Late 2021: <a href=/blog/2021/dev/>Got a job</a></h3><h2 id=empty-2>🧑‍💻</h2><p>After having learned both front-end and back-end, I realized I hated front-end and would hate to write any, so I began focusing more on topics relating to back-end like JWT authentication, REST API HTTP servers, and of course databases (both SQL and NoSQL).</p><p>After feeling confident about my skills as a junior back-end developer who learned all of these within 10 months, I tried emailing countless companies to apply for software development jobs.</p><p>Only one replied. And it was <a href=https://cleverse.com>Cleverse</a>, a Thai startup well known in Thailand for its talented young developers. And now I&rsquo;m working as Cleverse back-end software engineer, perhaps the first one in the dev team to write back-end code without a proper college degree.</p><p>After working for Cleverse, I have learned a lot of programming best practices, and have since been incorporating those good designs into my own code. You can see on my GitHub page that I have been heavily refactoring <a href=https://github.com/soyart/fngobot>FnGoBot</a> and <a href=https://github.com/soyart/gfc>gfc</a> during this period.</p><h2 id=list-of-my-software-released-in-2021>List of my software released in 2021</h2><ol><li><p><a href=https://github.com/soyart/gfc>gfc</a> - a simple, stupid CLI file/console encryption/decryption tool using AES-256 GCM, AES-256 CTR, and RSA OAEP SHA256. It can output raw ciphertext, or hex/base64 formated ciphertext. Likewise, its ciphertext input can be either raw, hex, or base64.</p></li><li><p><a href=https://github.com/soyart/fngobot>FnGoBot</a> - a simple, stupid Telegram chatbot for financial securities. This project helped me learn development planning, good and modular design..</p></li><li><p><a href=https://github.com/soyart/doggovac>DoggoVac</a> - a full-stack simple, stupid canine and feline vaccination tracker for small vet businesses, with both back-end and front-end written in Javascript. Try it on <a href=https://doggovac.artnoi.com>doggovac.artnoi.com</a> Warning: The code is not very pleasant to look at. It works well though - my family currently use our private instance to store out pets&rsquo; vaccination data.</p></li><li><p><a href=https://github.com/soyart/19>19</a> - a global COVID-19 tracker with data from OWID. It is front-end only and is currently hosted on <a href=https://19.artnoi.com>19.artnoi.com</a>.</p></li><li><p><a href=https://github.com/soyart/csc>csc</a> - a simple, stupid file checksum utility. It currently supports MD5, SHA1, and SHA256 hash algorithms.</p></li></ol><h2 id=2022-plans>2022 Plans</h2><h3 id=learn-rust>Learn Rust</h3><h2 id=empty-3>⚙️</h2><p>I want to be able to write <a href=https://github.com/soyart/gfc>gfc</a> in Rust this year.</p><h3 id=learn-more-devops>Learn more DevOps</h3><h2 id=empty-4>🎛️</h2><p>I&rsquo;m quite conservative when it comes to my servers. I don&rsquo;t use containers or orchestration at all. This is very different from real world production servers. So if I want to pursue my career in backend software development, I need to learn more about tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and Google Cloud.</p><h3 id=teach-programming>Teach programming</h3><h2 id=empty-5>🧑‍🏫</h2><p>A handful of my close friends have asked me to help them with their programming. I&rsquo;m quite confident that if the friends actually put in their efforts, they all can get what I got.</p><h3 id=be-more-emotionally-intelligent>Be more emotionally intelligent</h3><h2 id=empty-6>🧑‍🤝‍🧑</h2><p>I noticed that, after 7 years of smoking weed non-stop, my EQ has dropped significantly. I can&rsquo;t regulate my urges well enough for a 25-year-old man. I&rsquo;m still working on how should I approach this.</p><h2 id=carpe-annum>🔥 Carpe Annum! 🔥</h2><p>2022 is MY year! And I will make it happen!</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Standing on the hill in my mountains of dreams, telling myself it&rsquo;s not as hard, hard, hard as it seems&rdquo;</p></blockquote><hr><p><a href=#top>Back to top</a></p><hr><footer><p>Copyright (c) 2019 Prem Phansuriyanon</p><p>Verbatim copying and redistribution of this entire page are permitted provided this notice is preserved</p></footer></body></html>

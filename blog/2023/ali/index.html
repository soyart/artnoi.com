ALI was first meant to be a big web of shell scripts, but later evolved into just a declarative YAML specification.</p> <p>It is designed based on my own experience of maintaining Arch Linux systems as hobby and at my previous job.</p> <p><a href=https://github.com/soyart/ali-rs>ali-rs</a> is the reference implementation for ALI, with manifest validation and other features aimed at simplifying and standardizing Arch Linux installations.</p> <p>Users can use ALI and ali-rs to create somewhat reproducible Arch Linux systems.</p> <h2 id=ali-vs-cloud-init-or-autoinstall>ALI vs cloud-init or autoinstall</h2> <p><strong>The most clear difference between ALI and <a href=https://cloud-init.io>cloud-init</a> is that ALI is just a YAML specification</strong>, while cloud-init is a full-fledged platform for configuring Linux machines for the cloud, and comes with its own set of mostly Python tools.</p> <p>Unlike cloud-init and autoinstall, ALI does not aim to always create a full, bootable system. Parts of the declaration can be omitted, and ALI can be used to just bootstrap a new chroot environment.</p> <p>This allows ALI users to use ALI to create an Arch Linux system anywhere; users can use ALI for creating a new Arch environment on a real disk with a bootloader, or as chroot mountpoints.</p> <p>While cloud-init is more fully-featured, it can be an overkill for (my) personal use, and the feedback users get from applying the cloud-init manifests is not instant - you&#8217;d need to reboot to re-apply cloud-init manifests.</p> <p>Users can even just use ALI to partition their disks for them, while the users perform the actual installation.</p> <p>Or users can manually partition the disks before using ALI to populate&#47;configure the systems.</p> <p>Another difference is that cloud-init is run at boot time, right before the system fully boots, while ALI, as a standard, does not have this limitation.</p> <h2 id=ali-rs>ali-rs</h2> <p>After the spec is published, I began working on a reference implementation.</p> <p><a href=https://github.com/soyart/ali-rs>ali-rs</a> is that implementation, written in Rust because <a href=/blog/2023/try-rust/ >I wanted to learn the language</a>.</p> <p>This implementation is a single binary Rust program, and it fully supports all of ALI features, with its own extra features not found in ALI, like manifest validation.</p> <p>ali-rs is currently 70-80% done, with all of ALI features implemented but not yet completely tested. I occasionally use it to install Arch Linux to new Vultr VPS.</p> <p>ali-rs has manifest validation built-in and enabled by default, which means that, if there&#8217;s no bug (ahem), ali-rs would never wipe your data on existing block devices. This makes ali-rs safe to use on non-clean slate scenarios.</p> <p>In addition to arbitary shell commands, ali-rs also features its own sub-language called <a href=https://github.com/soyart/ali-rs/blob/master/HOOKS.md>hooks</a>, which are just simple text interface for configuring Arch Linux systems in an opinionated way.</p> <p>This means that even though ALI does not have boot features, users still have the means to provide bootloader configuration programmatically via shell scripts or ali-rs hooks.</p> <hr> <p><a href=#top>Back to top</a></p> <hr> <footer> <p>Copyright (c) 2019 - 2023 Prem Phansuriyanon</p> <p>Verbatim copying and redistribution of this entire page are permitted provided this notice is preserved</p> </footer> </body> </html>

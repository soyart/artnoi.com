If I, a noob, have to host a public website on the internet, I&#8217;d rather prefer the most secure OS by defaults as my webserver box.</p> <p>But lately, I&#8217;ve been thinking, if I could delegate this public-facing component with someone else&#8217;s, then I wouldn&#8217;t have to worry about being hacked!</p> <h2 id=How>How</h2> <p>I just simply added a GitHub Actions file in <a href=https://github.com/soyart/webtools>webtools</a>, and this will build and deploy my websites to GitHub Pages with my custom domain name.</p> <p>I push the new articles markdowns and the website gets updated like before, but without the risks of having my personal servers attacked.</p> <p>Laziness wins I guess.</p> <hr> <p><a href=#top>Back to top</a></p> <hr> <footer> <p>Copyright (c) 2019 - 2023 Prem Phansuriyanon</p> <p>Verbatim copying and redistribution of this entire page are permitted provided this notice is preserved</p> </footer> </body> </html>

<h1 id="artnoi-com-is-now-using-github-pages">artnoi.com is now using GitHub Pages</h1>

<p>As much as I prefer self-hosting the website,
my current responsibilities have been limiting
my free time for maintaining the website.</p>

<p>While I&rsquo;ve setup an old-school CI/CD pipelines
using shell scripts on my OpenBSD box to sync
website files from Git repo periodically,
I&rsquo;m tired of worrying about security.</p>

<h2 id="but-you-said-openbsd-was-cool">But you said OpenBSD was cool</h2>

<p>The only reason I chose OpenBSD as previous webserver
was because of security concerns. If I, a normal person,
have to host a public website on the internet,
I&rsquo;d rather prefer the most secure OS by defaults
as my webserver box.</p>

<p>But lately, I&rsquo;ve been thinking, if I could
delegate this public-facing component with someone else&rsquo;s,
then I wouldn&rsquo;t have to worry about it being hacked!</p>

<h2 id="how">How</h2>

<p>I just simply added a GitHub Actions file in <a href="https://github.com/soyart/webtools">webtools</a>,
and this will build and deploy my websites to GitHub Pages
with my custom domain name.</p>

<p>I push the new articles markdowns and the website
gets updated like before, but without the risks of having my
personal servers attacked.</p>

<p>Laziness wins I guess.</p>

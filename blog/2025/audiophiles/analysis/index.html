in schools, workplace, or within the family.</p><p>They all work different jobs - from business owners, professors,
software engineers, and even doctors. Some even have electrical engineering degrees,
or even audio engineering degrees.</p><p>They also focus on different listening apparatus: some like headphones, some like speakers.
Some are crazy about car audio.</p><p>I have met so many audiophiles throughout my life. My first experience with
one was when I was 6 where I was introduced to the world of gold cables, and horn speakers.</p><p>At some point, I even considered myself an audiophile, and have bought so many
audiophile products like a hi-fi USB cable and a discrete class A headphone amplifier</p><p>They all have many differences, but one thing unites them all: their esoteric art of listening to audio devices.</p><h2 id=what-is-an-audiophile>What is an audiophile</h2><p>An audiophile is in the dumbest sense someone who likes audio fidelity.</p><p>In modern usage, an <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audiophile>audiophile</a> is someone whose goal
is to enjoy <strong>high-fidelity</strong> <em>audio reproduction</em> (playback of audio, as opposed to recording).</p><blockquote><p>However, there&rsquo;re many people with technical expertise that are also concerned with audio fidelity.
But because these do not fit the <a href=../characteristics/>characteristics</a>, they are not called audiophiles.
Instead, they are just called serious music lovers.</p></blockquote><p>Audiophiles are rare breed of humans, with self-proclaimed superhuman hearing
and exceptional knowledge of audio circuitry engineering and music.</p><p>They first appeared not long after home audio became affordable.</p><p>And despite all the technological advances in audio since 1960s,
audiophiles could still find faults on modern day consumer audio equipment, <em>by ear</em>.</p><p>The ceiling for improvement knows no limit for audiophiles, as they believe they can always
milk better sound out of the same music with a little overengineering, like with this <a href=https://www.sony.jp/rec-media/products/SR-HXA/>Sony high-res audio SD card</a> (<a href=https://www.eevblog.com/forum/blog/eevblog-719-sony-low-noise-audiophile-sdxc-memory-card/>discussed here</a>).</p><p>They can&rsquo;t agree on which technologies are the best sounding: analog vinyl vs lossless digital music,
or tube amplifiers vs solid state amplifiers.</p><p>Their pursuit of perfect audio push their standards far past the naive audio engineers&rsquo;,
who are deaf (compared to the audiophiles) and only do funny maths. These <em>pro</em> audio devices
the engineers use are all crap compared to the high-end audiophile hardware, and it&rsquo;s normal
for high-end audiophile equipments to cost more than the pro audio hardware in the studios.</p><blockquote><p>Other weird thing is they respect and trust <em>fellow</em> cultured audiophiles who belive in
different technology than they do more than they trust real audio engineers.</p><p>For example, there might be a guy called George who&rsquo;s well known in his forum as analog-tube-horn god
and a random digital-only audiophile who&rsquo;s only into digital audio
will respect George&rsquo;s opinions regarding audio fidelity, simply because George&rsquo;s gear is expensive and &ldquo;high-end&rdquo;.</p></blockquote><p>But, are these so-called audiophiles actually pursuing their goals of audio fidelity rationally?</p><p>Let&rsquo;s find out.</p><h2 id=what-is-audio-fidelity>What is audio fidelity</h2><p><a href=/blog/etc/audio-fidelity>Audio fidelity</a> is faithfulness of the system transporting/transducing audio signal.</p><p>The better fidelity, the more &ldquo;true to original&rdquo; the audio is. The ideal fidelity is 100% fidelity,
which means that the output audio signal is perfectly identical with the source audio.</p><p>This alone implies that 2 very high-fidelity audio systems will have very small differences,
as they both sound very close to the original to the point that the differences are inaudible by human ear.</p><p>There are ways to quantify fidelity, which are discussed in this <a href=/blog/etc/audio-fidelity>blog post</a>.</p><h2 id=analysis-of-audiophiles>Analysis of audiophiles</h2><p>We can (falsely) deduce that audiophiles are idiots based on their <a href=../characteristics/>characteristics</a> and patterns.
But most audiophiles I personally know are far from simple idiots.</p><p>In fact, they are usually above-average in intelligence, and even more above-average in wealth.
Some are even very smart, like doctors and my previous engineering manager,
who perfectly understand difficult technical context regarding audio.</p><p>So, why have they fallen to bullshit marketing?
Why a software engineer would want expensive headphone cables?
Why a doctor buy and place his quantum room treatment rock on his speakers?</p><p>These questions drove me mad, so I tried to reason with all this insanity.
<strong>The answer is very human, complex, and has nothing to do with individual&rsquo;s technical intelligence</strong>.
The answer lies in how our human nature: our needs to relate to other people, our sense of belonging,
intragroup competition, &ldquo;face saving&rdquo;, etc.</p><p>And after I arrived at my answer, I also came up with another conclusion:
<strong>Once they&rsquo;re an audiophile, always an audiophile</strong>.</p><p>But before we jump to the <a href=#conclusion>conclusion</a>, let&rsquo;s first put ourselves into the shoes of an audiophile.</p><h3 id=how-someone-becomes-an-audiophile>How someone becomes an audiophile</h3><p>An audiophile is usually some rich dude with enough spare time, let&rsquo;s call him Bob.</p><p>As discussed, audiophiles are everywhere. So chances are Bob&rsquo;s got to know some audiophiles in his social circle already.</p><p>Bob will then be first introduced to hi-fi audio by some audiopiles they personally know, like his friend John.
Since this friend John is in the same social circle as Bob, Bob will trust John&rsquo;s judgement and experience some how.</p><p>When John&rsquo;s introducing Bob to hi-fi audio, John will talk about all the esoteric tech or equipment needed for hi-fi
that normies don&rsquo;t know about. This conversation captivates Bob, who also dreams of owning such high-performance
audio system for himself so that he can enjoy live jazz concert by top artists in his living room.</p><p>This introduction memory will burn into the Bob&rsquo;s brain: to have hi-fi audio, everything in the system has to be hi-fi.
BUT John never told Bob what exactly does &ldquo;high fidelity&rdquo; means, or how to verify it. To John, high fidelity comes not
from the actual measurable performance but from having all of the components being expensive.</p><p>Now Bob has fallen into the rabbit hole, and he&rsquo;ll be out looking to buy and build up his own audio system, and he will
ask John for feedback for his purchase choices.</p><p>When I first went to visit my rich Singaporean uncle back in 2006, he walked me down into his underground
listening room, with all the fancy audio equipment. He also told me the insane price of his cables, as well as how his
richer friend is rocking even more expensive cables, and how price will usually increases with quality.</p><h3 id=early-stage-audiophiles>Early-stage audiophiles</h3><p>Because John, who has never uttered a word about audio measurements, taught Bob about <em>all the basics</em> (e.g. silver sounds bright),
Bob will not look at the specs or find measurements for the stuff he&rsquo;s buying.</p><p>Bob&rsquo;s first purchase is a headphone, say, Sennheiser HD650. And he did enjoy his new purchases for quite a while.
Because this is Bob&rsquo;s first hi-fi equipment, he was so shocked at the amazing sound his new headphones can produce.</p><p>He wonders if he could get even better sound, so he asks John for guidance
John scolds Bob for driving his HD650 directly from his phonem and recommends that Bob buy a headphone amplifier
to produce more oompf and to be able to drive studio headphones properly.</p><p>John did not even ask how loud the headphones get when driven by a phone, but he jumps straight into his conclusion
that the phone, despite getting the headphones to be loud enough, lacks the power to bring up hidden music details.</p><p>So Bob goes out and buys an headphone amplifier.</p><p>This cycle continues until Bob finally have his own mobile DAC/AMP and desktop dedicated DAC and amplifiers, along
with a dozen of fancy cables.</p><h3 id=mature-audiophiles>Mature audiophiles</h3><p>Bob is now rocking a very expensive hi-fi equipment.</p><p>He&rsquo;s very proud of his system, which he meticulously built up until it&rsquo;s finally the best audio system for the money.
After dozens of purchases and years of experience, Bob finally could hear the minute details John was talking about.</p><p>Now he&rsquo;s no longer an apprentice, but a master audiophile in his own rights. He now posts on HeadFi with confidence,
and he could tell how an equipment will sound like based purely on brands, internet pictures, and some keywords in the
marketing materials.</p><p>For example, now when Bob sees a big, black, and solidly built amplifier from company A, he&rsquo;ll use his own algorithm
to compute the sound signature score based on these inputs. This time, he deduces that the amplifier will have
very low noise floor (black) with very powerful output (big), with a sweet house sound from Company A. Bob thinks to
himself that this amplifier will be perfect for jazz and vocal music, but will be too <em>slow</em> for rock or metal music.</p><p>Now Bob can always find some issues with his system, e.g. noise floor, sound stage, and airiness. He also has already
formulated his own plan to fix each of these issues, e.g. buy audiophile power outlets to fix the noise,
or using silver cable to extend the soundstage.</p><p>At this stage, Bob is actively trying to mix-and-match his setup for maximum harmony. In other words, Bob knows
exactly why his system sounds the way it does, which components are responsible for sound stage.</p><p>This might be his real thoughts: <em>&ldquo;if I&rsquo;m using silver cable, so the sound might be bright.
But all those trebles will be tamed by my NOS DAC, which is warm&rdquo;</em>.</p><h3 id=awakening-an-audiophile>Awakening an audiophile</h3><p>Awakening in this context is when an audiophile finally realizes his own stupidity, and willingness to admit to past mistakes,
and switchs side to the objective audio camp.</p><p>If an audiophile is still in his early stages, we might be able to fix him with science and reasons.</p><p>But if an audiophile has reached the mature stage, then the chance that we will be able to fix him will be very low.
Why? It&rsquo;s because the audiophile derives so many enjoyment from owning the equipment. It&rsquo;s because they alreadt spent
thousands of dollars for cables that won&rsquo;t make a difference.</p><p>Admitting that subjectivity is useless and scammy will destroy the audiophile&rsquo;s entire understanding of audio fidelity.
An entire world.</p><p>He will have to admit that he was scammed to buy expensive Ethernet cables, diamond-tipped cable stands, and quantum room treatment.
He will also have to argue with someone they know like John, and other audiophiles in his social group.
He will also have to change the way he thinks of his golden ear, previously source of his pride, and admit that his ears
can no longer hear anything above 13kHz.</p><p>The admission of stupidity and his network effect prevent a mature audiophile to be awaken. So they will double down,
and forever be victims of scam companies. How can they handle the idea that they were systematically scammed to pay $999
for 0.5m USB cable.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Audiophiles think highly of their knowledge, listening poweress, and taste in equipment.
Their equipments are also super expensive and seem illogical to most people.</p><p>They enjoy bragging to normal people that they are so good at listening music
that they need to have all these expensive cables and bullshit.</p><p>Audiophiles also enjoy discussing about pseudo-science technical topics together.
It makes them feel super knowledgable and exclusive, like audio wizards chanting ancient foreign language mantras.
There&rsquo;re a bunches of audiophile forum posts where they all discuss about electronic circuits
and how capacitors from brand A or B will affect overall signal flow in the circuits.</p><p>These topics include how chemical elements all have their own sound signature,
or how digital audio works and why they need 24-bit audio played back by
non-oversampling DAC with NOS silicon over silver Ethernet cable.</p><p>They&rsquo;re also very proud of their expensive components, which &ldquo;required&rdquo; so much knowledge and experience to buy.
Buying super expensive audio equipment will land you in an exclusive golden ear club, where members all have golden ear
and the money to fix any audio issues.</p><p>By converting to the objectivity gang, the audiophiles must accept the ugly truth that their smart asses were
all collectively scammed by non-scientific advertisements all this time.</p><p>They&rsquo;ll have to admit that their hard-earned listening experience and knowledge is all bullshit,
existing only in their own head. And they must admit that all those respectable audiophiles,
who they might look up to with great respect, has been full of shit all along.</p><p>So they will stay that way and defend those expensive audio devices they cherish with great ferocity,
for the opposite is to admit that the whole system is built with fake knowledge but real money.</p><hr><p><a href=#top>Back to top</a></p><hr><footer><p>Copyright (c) 2019 Prem Phansuriyanon</p><p>Verbatim copying and redistribution of this entire page are permitted provided this notice is preserved</p></footer></body></html>

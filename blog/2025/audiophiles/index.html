The ideal fidelity is 100% fidelity,
which means that the output audio signal is perfectly identical with the source audio.</p><p>This alone implies that 2 very high-fidelity audio systems will have very small differences,
as they both sound very close to the original to the point that the differences are inaudible.</p><p>There are ways to quantify fidelity, which are discussed in this <a href=/artnoi.com/src/blog/etc/audio-fidelity/index.md>blog post</a>.</p><h2 id=what-is-an-audiophile>What is an audiophile</h2><p>An audiophile is in the dumbest sense someone who likes audio fidelity.</p><p>In modern usage, an audiophile is someone whose goal is to enjoy <strong>high-fidelity</strong> audio <em>reproduction</em> (playback of audio, as opposed to recording).</p><p>But, are these so-called audiophiles actually pursuing their goals of audio fidelity rationally?</p><p>Let&rsquo;s find out.</p><h2 id=characteristics-of-audiophiles>Characteristics of audiophiles</h2><p>I usually looks for these traits when labeling people as audiophiles.
Self-proclaimed audiophiles or those participating on audiophile-centric webforums usually have very similar traits.</p><p>These traits are ranked by my own bullshit score, i.e. the lower the trait, the more stupid the fallacies.</p><p>If one only have a few traits at the top, then we can still save them.
But if they exhibit behaviors of bottom traits, then we might as well
save our own sanity by not caring about their opinion.</p><ul><li><p>Underestimation or total disregard of room noise and treshold of hearing</p><blockquote><p>TLDR: To hear everything actually requires you to listen at very dangerously loud volume.
Otherwise all those delicate and quiet details will be masked by room noise.</p><p>This means that in most situations, those artifacts are inaudible to the listener.</p></blockquote><p>Because high-fidelity audio gears produce very almost identical sound (by definition),
to be able to hear the differences, you&rsquo;ll need to hear all of the sound, including
the quitest part of the audio.</p><p>Recall that, music is usually enjoyed privately at 70-85dB (without regard to room noise), and room noise is ~30dB.
These numbers indicate that to be able to hear the audio equipment&rsquo;s differences in a standard room,
you will need to listen at more than 100dB. This will damage their hearing to be able to hear those small artifacts.</p><p>If they disregard the room noise and proceed to play music at 80dB, then they&rsquo;ll have 50dB SINAD, thus they won&rsquo;t
hear any differences in high fidelity audio devices.</p></li><li><p>Focus on gear as opposed to objective measurement</p><p>Audiophiles don&rsquo;t care about the numbers or other objective evidence. Only physical equipment can prove points.
Audiophiles will laugh in your face if you listen to your headphones directly from your phone.</p><p>For example, let&rsquo;s say we have a pair of high impedance earphones, like a pair of CIEM.
Also let&rsquo;s say that somehow, the iPhone dongle manages to drive the earphones loud enough at around 70% volume.</p><p>If you were me, you would stop caring about the equipment and keep using the dongle,
which actually happens to be quite good <a href=https://www.kenrockwell.com/apple/lightning-adapter-audio-quality.htm>(it has >100dB SINAD, low output impedance of 1 ohm, and its small and compact)</a>.
If an audiophile sees you trying out the new hi-fi headphones with the dongle, he would however think that you are mad for not using dedicated
mobile DAC/AMP to drive those expensive headphones.</p><p>This actually happened to me when trying out CIEM universal demo pairs - the woman working at the audio shop
laughed in my face for using the dongle to drive 6-driver CIEMs and even persuade me to buy other equipment
before buying the expensive CIEMs. The shopkeeper insists that I should use their DAC/AMP
to be able to properly evaluate the headphones.</p></li><li><p>Hold their audio knowledge, experience, and perception in very high regard</p><p>This attitude is frequently seen online - a self-proclaimed audiophile claims to have golden ears
and that he could hear the difference between two 0.5-meter USB cables.</p><p>They believe themselves to be in an exclusive group of humans who have exceptional hearing ability,
and taste in their audio equipment. Only words from these groups matter when it comes to audio,
since other people lack the expertise and experience to talk about audio. Even audio engineers are
shunned.</p><p>Audiophiles believe mainstream audio engineers (who don&rsquo;t work in Hi-Fi manufacturers)
are great at recording and mastering, but very naive with playback.</p></li><li><p>Overengineered but very old technology = more musical than modern solutions</p><p>Tube vs solid state, discrete components vs integrated circuit, class A amplifier vs other class,
vinyls vs digital music, and more.</p><p>But there&rsquo;re also times when newer technologies are loved by audiophiles. It&rsquo;s when the new tech
is very expensive, or is being marketed by audiophile-centric companies (like MQA, DSD, high-end digital cables, Roon)</p></li><li><p>Don&rsquo;t understand the importance of volume-matching when doing comparisons</p><p>They don&rsquo;t realize that pushing up the volume can change the sound signature heard at the eardrum.
Usually, louder volume when push the quieter sounds up to audible level, resulting in more &ldquo;open&rdquo;, &ldquo;airy&rdquo;,
and fuller sound.</p></li><li><p>Don&rsquo;t understand basic technical details of the world (building electrical wiring, digital signal, software)</p><p>This is usually not a problem, but would be one if the person making
some big technical claim claim lacks the qualification to do so in the first place.</p><p>Folks like this will pay for expensive audiophile SD cards, and power and ground their own listening room
separately from the rest of the house.</p></li><li><p>Buy expensive power cables, outlets, or even dedicated audio ground in the dirt, for sound</p><p>Audiophiles believe that the electric power coming into their equipment must be very <em>clean</em> (devoid of mains noise),
due to their simplistic &ldquo;garbage in, garbage out&rdquo; mindset.</p><p>So they spend thousands on a big ass power cable for their equipment, with golden plugs too.</p><p>When there&rsquo;s nothing else to improve in the power department, they buy audiophile power outlets.</p></li><li><p>Care about marketing terms or trademarks</p><p>They see some trademarks, they correlate the name to sound signature.
For example, they see THX AAA, they jump to the conclusion that the sound will be dry.</p><p>They see MQA, they&rsquo;ll say the audio sounds more pleasant than a flac of the same master.</p></li><li><p>Buy expensive analog cables, for sound</p><p>It&rsquo;s totally okay to buy expensive analog cables for build quality and proper engineering.
Cable and charisteristics like wire gauge, shielding, or even good connectors are
totally valid points when buying expensive cables.</p><p>But buying Kryo&reg; Gold-Silver-Copper with quantum shield sleeve is totally idiotic.
They usually find &ldquo;silver&rdquo; cable to be brighter sounding (which implies loss of bass and/or elevated highs).</p></li><li><p>Buy expensive digital audio cables, for sound</p><p>Because they believe that digital signal may degrade audibly, they will ensure that the digital connection
is bit-perfect all the time. They&rsquo;ll buy expensive USB cables.</p></li><li><p>Buy expensive computer networking equipment, for sound</p><p>Like with digital audio cables, but way way worse because they don&rsquo;t even trust computer networking.
They buy Hi-Fi network switches, Ethernet cables to improve sound. Their argument is usually cheapo normie
networking cables will lose data, causing retransmission and jitter.</p><p>They forgot that they can just buy faster cable to stream their 700kbps audio if transmission speed was their concern.
They also forgot that if networking cables do lose so much data that the digital audio pipeline produced audible jitter,
then the world would cromble down years ago due to more serious problems arising from &ldquo;bad&rdquo; networking, like ATC and satellites.</p></li><li><p>Shape, look, and feel of object somehow reflects its sound signature</p><p>If the object is lightweight, then it might lack &ldquo;power&rdquo; or &ldquo;punch&rdquo;.
If an object is made of copper, then its sound signature&rsquo;ll be bassy.</p></li></ul><h2 id=analysis-of-audiophiles>Analysis of audiophiles</h2><p>We can (falsely) deduce that audiophiles are idiots based on their characteristics and patterns.
But most audiophiles I personally know are far from idiots.</p><p>In fact, they are usually above-average in intelligence, and even more above-average in wealth.
Some are even very smart, like doctors and my previous engineering manager,
who perfectly understand difficult technical context regarding audio.</p><p>So, why have they fallen to bullshit marketing?
Why a software engineer would want expensive headphone cables?
Why a doctor buy and place his quantum room treatment rock on his speakers?</p><p>These questions drove me mad, so I tried to reason with all this insanity.
And after I arrived at my answer, I also came up with another conclusion: that these people will not change.</p><h3 id=how-someone-becomes-an-audiophile>How someone becomes an audiophile</h3><p>An audiophile is usually some rich dude with enough spare time, let&rsquo;s call him Bob.</p><p>Bob will be first introduced to hi-fi audio by some audiopiles they personally know, like his friend John.
Since this friend John is in the same social circle as Bob, Bob will trust John&rsquo;s judgement and experience some how.</p><p>When John&rsquo;s introducing Bob to hi-fi audio, John will talk about all the esoteric tech or equipment needed for hi-fi
that normies don&rsquo;t know about.</p><blockquote><p>For example, when I first went to visit my rich Singaporean uncle back in 2006, he walked me down into his underground
listening room, with all the fancy audio equipment. He also told me the insane price of his cables, as well as how his
richer friend is rocking even more expensive cables, and how price will usually increases with quality.</p></blockquote><p>This introduction memory will burn into the Bob&rsquo;s brain: to have hi-fi audio, everything in the system has to be hi-fi.
BUT John never told Bob what exactly does &ldquo;high fidelity&rdquo; means, or how to verify it. To John, high fidelity comes not
from the actual measurable performance but from having all of the components being expensive.</p><p>Now Bob has fallen into the rabbit hole, and he&rsquo;ll be out looking to buy and build up his own audio system, and he will
ask John for feedback for his purchase choices.</p><h3 id=early-stage-audiophiles>Early-stage audiophiles</h3><p>Because John, who has never uttered a word about audio measurements, taught Bob about <em>all the basics</em> (e.g. silver sounds bright),
Bob will not look at the specs or find measurements for the stuff he&rsquo;s buying.</p><p>Bob&rsquo;s first purchase is a headphone, say, Sennheiser HD650. And he did enjoy his new purchases for quite a while.
Because this is Bob&rsquo;s first hi-fi equipment, he was so shocked at the amazing sound his new headphones can produce.</p><p>He wonders if he could get even better sound, so he asks John for guidance
John scolds Bob for driving his HD650 directly from his phonem and recommends that Bob buy a headphone amplifier
to produce more oompf and to be able to drive studio headphones properly.</p><p>John did not even ask how loud the headphones get when driven by a phone, but he jumps straight into his conclusion
that the phone, despite getting the headphones to be loud enough, lacks the power to bring up hidden music details.</p><p>So Bob goes out and buys an headphone amplifier.</p><p>This cycle continues until Bob finally have his own mobile DAC/AMP and desktop dedicated DAC and amplifiers, along
with a dozen of fancy cables.</p><h3 id=mature-audiophiles>Mature audiophiles</h3><p>Bob is now rocking a very expensive hi-fi equipment.</p><p>He&rsquo;s very proud of his system, which he meticulously built up until it&rsquo;s finally the best audio system for the money.
After dozens of purchases and years of experience, Bob finally could hear the minute details John was talking about.</p><p>Now he&rsquo;s no longer an apprentice, but a master audiophile in his own rights. He now posts on HeadFi with confidence,
and he could tell how an equipment will sound like based purely on brands, internet pictures, and some keywords in the
marketing materials.</p><p>For example, now when Bob sees a big, black, and solidly built amplifier from company A, he&rsquo;ll use his own algorithm
to compute the sound signature score based on these inputs. This time, he deduces that the amplifier will have
very low noise floor (black) with very powerful output (big), with a sweet house sound from Company A. Bob thinks to
himself that this amplifier will be perfect for jazz and vocal music, but will be too <em>slow</em> for rock or metal music.</p><p>Now Bob can always find some issues with his system, e.g. noise floor, sound stage, and airiness. He also has already
formulated his own plan to fix each of these issues, e.g. buy audiophile power outlets to fix the noise,
or using silver cable to extend the soundstage.</p><p>At this stage, Bob is actively trying to mix-and-match his setup for maximum harmony. In other words, Bob knows
exactly why his system sounds the way it does, which components are responsible for sound stage.</p><p>This might be his real thoughts: <em>&ldquo;if I&rsquo;m using silver cable, so the sound might be bright.
But all those trebles will be tamed by my NOS DAC, which is warm&rdquo;</em>.</p><h3 id=awakening-an-audiophile>Awakening an audiophile</h3><p>Awakening in this context is when an audiophile finally realizes his own stupidity, and willingness to admit to past mistakes,
and switchs side to the objective audio camp.</p><p>If an audiophile is still in his early stages, we might be able to fix him with science and reasons.</p><p>But if an audiophile has reached the mature stage, then the chance that we will be able to fix him will be very low.
Why? It&rsquo;s because the audiophile derives so many enjoyment from owning the equipment. It&rsquo;s because they alreadt spent
thousands of dollars for cables that won&rsquo;t make a difference.</p><p>Admitting that subjectivity is useless and scammy will destroy the audiophile&rsquo;s entire understanding of audio fidelity.
He will have to admit that he was scammed to buy expensive Ethernet cables, diamond-tipped cable stands, and quantum room treatment.
He will also have to argue with John, and other audiophiles in his social group.
He will also have to change the way he thinks of his golden ear, previously source of his pride, and admit that his ears
can no longer hear anything above 13kHz.</p><p>The admission of stupidity and his network effect prevent a mature audiophile to be awaken. So they will double down,
and forever be victims of scam companies. How can they handle the idea that they were systematically scammed to pay $999
for 0.5m USB cable.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Audiophiles think highly of their knowledge, listening poweress, and taste in equipment.</p><p>They enjoy bragging to normies normies that their USB cable is very overpriced,
but is a neccessity because he could not stand normal USB cables due to his golden ears.</p><p>They also enjoy talking about pseudo-science technical topics, like how chemical elements will sound differently as cables,
or how digital audio works and why they need 24-bit audio played back over silver Ethernet cable.</p><p>They <em>understand</em> basic signal processing, like how DACs have low-pass filters, aliasing, and all that nerdy stuff.
They also know enough about computer networking (and OS sound mixer).</p><p>They&rsquo;re also very proud of their expensive components, which &ldquo;required&rdquo; so much knowledge and experience to buy.
Buying super expensive audio equipment will land you in an exclusive golden ear club, where members all have golden ear
and the money to fix any audio issues.</p><p>By awakening, the audiophiles must accept the ugly truth that they scammed by non-scientific advertisements all this time.
They&rsquo;ll have to admit that their hard-earned listening experience and knowledge is all bullshit, existing only in their own head.
And they must admit that all those respectable audiophiles, who they might look up to, is full of shit.</p><hr><p><a href=#top>Back to top</a></p><hr><footer><p>Copyright (c) 2019 Prem Phansuriyanon</p><p>Verbatim copying and redistribution of this entire page are permitted provided this notice is preserved</p></footer></body></html>

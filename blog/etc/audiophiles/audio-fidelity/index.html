Ethan Winer defines audio fidelity for you:</p><blockquote><p>Sound, for all the nuance and excitement it offers,
only operates in two dimensions: Time and intensity.</p><p>In turn, only four parameters are needed to assess
everything that affects audio fidelity.</p></blockquote><p>Sound is 2D wave, and we usually only need 4 parameters to judge overall performance.</p><h2 id=noise>Noise</h2><p>Anything not present in the source material is called noise.</p><p>If the input is silence, but there&rsquo;s a hiss in the output, that hiss is noise.
If the input is a 0dBFS 1kHz tone, but the output has some other components like
sidebands at 5khz and 2kHz, the sum of those components constitute noise.</p><p>Noise is bad because it coexists with the main signal, degrading it by masking.</p><p>We can measure noise in dB below our main signal. Ideally, we want a system with
noise level ~100dB lower than the main signal. This means that we&rsquo;ll have to crank
up the volume over 100dB just to hear 0-1dB of noise.</p><p>Most audio devices these days are very good in the noise department, thanks to
improvements in engineering and prevalence of other noise-sensitive electronics
that required engineers to fix noise issues.</p><p>Only truly shitty audio products have noise level lower than 80dB.</p><h2 id=frequency-response>Frequency response</h2><p>A <em>flat</em> response means that your system, when fed signals of varying frequencies
but of the same amplitude, will output the same amplitude for all frequencies.</p><p>If the response is not flat, then the output signal will have different amplitude.
If there&rsquo;s a dip, then the amplitude at the dip frequencies will be lower (quieter).
If there&rsquo;s a peak or a boost in the bass range response, lower frequencies will be
louder, resulting in warmer, bassier sounds.</p><p>The ideal frequency response is is a flat line across audible range. Most audio
devices today are flat, except for transducers like speakers and headphones.</p><h2 id=distortion>Distortion</h2><p>How audio signal may distort, i.e. incorrectly manifest. There&rsquo;re many types of
distortion, but we&rsquo;ll focus on two: harmonic distortion and
intermodulation distortion (IMD).</p><p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distortion#Harmonic_distortion>Harmonic distortion</a>
is when the output features some weird tones at frequencies that are multiple to
the input signal. Most harmonic distortion is &ldquo;2nd harmonic&rdquo;, i.e. at 2x the input frequency.</p><p>Due to how our brain and ear works, harmonic distortion may sound ok or even pleasant
to the ear, because it&rsquo;s somehow musically related to the input signal.</p><p>We can sum up all of those harmonic distortion into <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_harmonic_distortion>Total Harmonic Distortion (THD)</a>,
usually expressed as percentage e.g. 1% THD. Some measurements also show THD and noise
as a parameter: THD+N, usually expressed as dBFS.</p><p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermodulation>Intermodulation distortion</a> is a different beast.
IMD is a result of amplitude modulation of different input frequencies.</p><p>Unlike harmonic distortions, IMD manifests across the frequency band and sounds very bad because
the noise is musically not related the input tone. IMD is, like THD, expressed as THD.</p><p>A 1% THD is much better than 1% IMD.</p><h2 id=time-based-errors>Time-based errors</h2><p>Since sound is naturally a longitudinal wave with time as one of its axis,
large time-based errors <em>will</em> affect other parameters.</p><p>An example would be analog audio&rsquo;s <em>wow</em> (cassete tape standard ~ 0.08%)
or digital audio jitter (although I personally treat jitter as noise because
of how fast the timing errors are).</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>&ldquo;These four basic parameters define everything that affects audio fidelity.
As powerful as it is, there&rsquo;s no secret &ldquo;magic&rdquo; to sound, no unknown parameters
that &ldquo;science&rdquo; hasn&rsquo;t yet learned to identify, as is sometimes claimed.</p><p>The closer an audio signal is to the source across these four parameters,
the higher its fidelity.&rdquo; - Ethan Winer</p><p>We want our audio gear to have the best fidelity possible, so we focus on
minimizing noise, distortion, and time-based errors, while keeping the response flat.</p><hr><p><a href=#top>Back to top</a></p><hr><footer><p>Copyright (c) 2019 Prem Phansuriyanon</p><p>Verbatim copying and redistribution of this entire page are permitted provided this notice is preserved</p></footer></body></html>

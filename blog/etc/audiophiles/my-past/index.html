My first experience with
one was in 2004 when I was 6, where I was introduced to the world of gold cables, tube amps,
and horn speakers by a rich uncle.</p><p>Years later around 2010, I begin to buy my first quality audio products.
My first purchases are Grado-Alessandro MS-1i headphones and Monster Turbine earphones.
After my purchase, I began checking audiophile forums daily, reading reviews and discussions
for more expensive headphones and equipment.</p><p>That journey into audiophile forums turned me into an audiophile. Since, I had bought so many
audiophile products like a hi-fi USB cable and a discrete class A headphone amplifier,
and countless other hardware. I even ordered a custom made gold-silver-copper hybrid
10CM 3.5mm audio connector cable from a boutique maker, and a short handmade USB A-B interconnect
for my mobile DAC.</p><p>I quited being an audiophile back in around 2018 after I came across Ethan Winer&rsquo;s writings.
He wrote <a href=https://ethanwiner.com/book.htm>&ldquo;The Audio Expert&rdquo;</a>, a textbook in audio engineering
still in use in universities today.</p><p>By the time I quited, I already own a lot of audio gear. 2-3 desktop amplifiers, 2 mobile DAC/amps,
and a ton of headphones and earphones.</p><p>I naturally stop buying anything new except the transducers, until I bought the ER4SR.
The in-ear monitors are so good (and versatile) I just stop caring about other headphones,
except a custom monitors, which has always been my dream (it looks cool).
I only buy non-transducer stuff when I really need the functionality, like Bluetooth.</p><hr><p><a href=#top>Back to top</a></p><hr><footer><p>Copyright (c) 2019 Prem Phansuriyanon</p><p>Verbatim copying and redistribution of this entire page are permitted provided this notice is preserved</p></footer></body></html>

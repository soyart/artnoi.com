Note that this article is for Vim only and not <code>vi(1)</code>.</p> <h2 id=Normal%20mode>Normal mode</h2> <p>When you launch Vim, you are usually in Normal mode, which we usually use for <strong>navigating and entering editor commands</strong>, but NOT really for writing.</p> <blockquote> <p>For actual writing, we use Insert mode, which will be discussed later.</p> </blockquote> <p>To enter a command in Normal mode, press colon <code>:</code>, which will bring up the editor command prompt, and then enter the command.</p> <p>For example, to write out (save) a file after you&#8217;re done:</p> <pre><code class=language-vim>:write
</code></pre> <p>or in its short form:</p> <pre><code class=language-vim>:w
</code></pre> <p>Some of the more frequently used Vim commands are <code>w</code> for writing, <code>q</code> for quiting, <code>&#47;</code> to search for pattern, <code>s</code> and <code>%s</code> to substitute pattern, and <code>set</code> to set configuration, etc. You can try to set Vim to show line number with:</p> <pre><code class=language-vim>set number
set relativenumber
set invnumber
</code></pre> <h3 id=Normal%20mode%20navigation,%20and%20keybindings>Normal mode navigation, and keybindings</h3> <p>In Normal mode, you can navigate through your text with <strong>arrow keys</strong>, or what is dubbed <em>the Vim keys</em>: <strong>h, j, k, l keys</strong>.</p> <p>After some time, you&#8217;ll learn to love the Vim keys, because they are actually more comfortable to use and are actually more reliable if you work with different keyboards.</p> <p>Keybinding <code>G</code> will go to end of file, while <code>gg</code> will go to the beginning. <code>0</code> will go to the beginning of line, while <code>$</code> is for end of line. You can always navigate by word with <code>w</code>, or go backward by word with <code>b</code>. And the most frequently one for me is the dot <code>.</code> to execute previous command.</p> <h3 id=Some%20command%20examples>Some command examples</h3> <p>These directional keys can also be used in combination with other commands. For example, key <code>d</code> (binded to <code>:delete</code> command):</p> <pre><code>d0  = delete from cursor til beginning of line

d$  = delete from cursor til end of line

dgg = delete from cursor til beginning of file

dG  = delete from cursor til end of file

5dd = delete 5 lines from cursor

d&#47;text = delete up to pattern `text`
</code></pre> <p>I learned a lot from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlR5gYd6um0">this YouTube video</a> about how to expressively use these editor commands in a more efficient and intuitive manner.</p> <p>It is this combination of commands, bindings, regexp, etc. that makes Vim so loved by those who write a lot of text files.</p> <h2 id=Insert%20mode>Insert mode</h2> <p>To enter Insert mode, either use <code>:insert</code> command or press <em>i</em> key to insert text into Vim memory buffer. Note that This buffer will not be written to file until user gives the <code>:write</code> command.</p> <blockquote> <p>To exit the Insert mode (i.e. go back to Normal mode), press Esc.</p> </blockquote> <p>You can also press <em>A</em> (uppercase) to append the line (i.e. insert at the end of line).</p> <p>After you are done editting, use <code>write</code> (<code>w</code>) command to write the buffer to file:</p> <pre><code>:w
</code></pre> <p>Or save to another file;</p> <pre><code>:w &#60;FILENAME&#62;
</code></pre> <p>And quit Vim with <code>quit</code> (<code>q</code>) command:</p> <pre><code>:q
</code></pre> <p>Most people just combine these:</p> <pre><code>:wq
</code></pre> <p>Sometimes, you just want to quit. To force anything in Vim, append <code>!</code> to the command. If you want to discard the text you&#8217;ve been editing in Vim, then you can <em>force</em> quit without saving with:</p> <pre><code>:q!
</code></pre> <h2 id=Some%20newbie%20tricks>Some newbie tricks</h2> <p>Use <code>:tabedit</code> command to edit files in new Vim tab:</p> <pre><code>:tabedit &#60;FILENAME&#62;
</code></pre> <p>To enable mouse support, add this line to your <code>.vimrc</code> file (Vim configuration) in your home directory:</p> <pre><code class=language-vim>set mouse=a
</code></pre> <p>Or if you are using the same <code>.vimrc</code> on servers and desktops like I do:</p> <pre><code class=language-vim>    if has(&#39;mouse&#39;)
        set mouse=a
    endif
</code></pre> <p>Vim mouse support also works over SSH on many terminal emulators.</p> <h3 id=.vimrc>.vimrc</h3> <p><code>.vimrc</code> is where we store Vim &#8220;<em>run command</em>&#8221; configuration, apart from the <code>.vim</code> directory. My basic <code>.vimrc</code> looks like this:</p> <pre><code class=language-vim>" vim files
set viminfo=
set noswapfile
set nobackup
set undodir=$HOME&#47;.vim&#47;

" Editor settings
syntax on
set incsearch
set invnumber
set relativenumber
set smartindent
set tabstop=4 softtabstop=4
set shiftwidth=4
set cursorline
color iceberg

" Enable mouse in all modes if possible
if has(&#39;mouse&#39;)
    set mouse=a
endif

" Fixes backspace not working
set backspace=indent,eol,start
" Show the cursor position
set ruler
" Show the current mode
set showmode
" Show the filename in the window titlebar
set title
" Show the (partial) command as itâ€™s being typed
set showcmd
</code></pre> <p>Also, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlR5gYd6um0">watch this YouTube video</a> for yanking (<em>copy</em> text), pasting, and other cool <em>Vim language</em>.</p> <p>If you made it, congrats! You have just learned to master a very expressive, efficient text editor that doesn&#8217;t require graphic interface at all!</p> <p>I myself use Vim for almost everything, including this website. Even when programming, I find it much easier to use Vim with a tiling window manager than most other IDEs. Vim is the only software I install to my OpenBSD webserver.</p> <p>With Vim, you can artfully edit text anywhere from just a console.</p> <hr> <p><a href=#top>Back to top</a></p> <hr> <footer> <p>Copyright (c) 2019 - 2023 Prem Phansuriyanon</p> <p>Verbatim copying and redistribution of this entire page are permitted provided this notice is preserved</p> </footer> </body> </html>
